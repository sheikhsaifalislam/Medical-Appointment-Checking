# Medical Appointment Checking
 Investigate a Medical Appointment Dataset and Figure Out What Factors Influence patients' Scheduled Appointments Missing
 
 # Introduction:
Some Patients make an appointment and do not show up in the hospital, there are many reasons to explain this situation. This dataset was collected from 100,000 medical appointment from Brazil. By analyzing this dataframe, finding out the reasons and helping hospital to better imporve their service to patients.

# Conclusions
Based on data analysis:

1. Most new borned babies would meet their appointment in time. The median of patients' age for show-up group is 38, so patients who are around thirty-something prefer to go to hospital. Age could not be a main reason related to those missing appointments.

2. People would expect that patients who received reminder SMS would less likely to miss their appointment, but based on the analysis with question 2, we found the number of patients with no SMS is more than the opposite one. So, we could not say sending reminder SMS is a good way to remind patients, maybe there are more reasons including sending time, contents, reminder ways.

3. From the question 3 above, patients who waited for many days might not show up in their appointments. They might forget their appointment bacause of the long-wait. Or, they found another hospital to receive treatment and forget to cancel appointment. So, improving the hospital's effectiveness and speeding up the process so that patients would show up frequently.

# Limitations of dataset:
1. There are also many factors affect patients' attendance that the dataset did not include. If we want to have a thoughtful analysis, we need to consider many aspects such as the distance between patients' home and hospitals, and what kinds of transportation do patients choose? Or how much income of paients' family?

2. The dataset collects the data from many hospital in Brazil, for a better research of medical appointment system, we could collect more data in various countries like America, China, Britain etc. Because every country has its own medical system and it might change the results in different environment.
